            After graduating from South Dakota State University, my journey began with an internship at 
            USGS/EROS in South Dakota, where I later transitioned into a full-time role as a professional 
            software engineer. With three years of experience in front-end, back-end, and software internet 
            security, I am dedicated to bettering my coding skills and learn more about different programming languages and tools.

            Whenever I'm away from my desk, my interests span from rock climbing and hiking to crafting keyboards and cooking.
            <br><br>
            My dream is to find a job that not only enhances my technical skills but also takes them to the next level. I 
            am enthusiastic about the prospect of connecting with you and exploring potential synergies!
